## Environment

- OS : macOS Catalina 10.15.6
- Shell : Zsh

<br />

## Installation

<p>⚠︎Right now, I working on improving it so that it can be installed more easily.</p>

```
1. cd ~
2. git clone https://github.com/kitamura-hub/dotfiles.git
3. cd dotfiles
4. chmod +x link.sh
5. sh link.sh
```

<br />

## Thanks

<p>Thank you for taking a look at my dotfiles. I am still immature as a dotfiler. However, I will acquire a lot of knowledge and update to a better dot file from now on.</p>
